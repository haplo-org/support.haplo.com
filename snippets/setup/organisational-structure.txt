As well as the data about users, we need to know your organisational structure. Please provide this via the [node:setup/project-room] using the *Institutional structure* task, which will have been assigned to your technical lead for the project. This can be provided in any convenient format, but make sure:

* the hierarchy is clear, and

* it includes the codes used to identify the organisational units in the data files.

Each academic user should be a member of one of the organisational units described in this structure. In most cases, administrative staff do not need an organisational unit.

h3. Example

An organisation structure could be supplied as a spreadsheet such as: 

|*Code*|*Parent*|*Name*|
|U000||University of Example|
|S000|U000|Science and Technology|
|S100|S000|Computer Science|
|S102|S100|Engineering|
|S923|S100|Civil Engineering|
|S650|S100|Architecture|
|L002|S000|Life Sciences|
|L006|L002|Medical|
|H002|U000|Humanities|
|H200|H002|English|
|H205|H200|Literature|
|H304|H002|Law|
|H302|H002|Politics|

The *Code* is the value which appears in the user feed file. *Parent* is the code of the parent organisational unit in the hierarchy. *Name* is the name which should be displayed to the user.

The above example represents the following structure:

* University of Example
** Science and Technology
*** Computer Science
*** Engineering
**** Civil Engineering
**** Architecture
*** Life Sciences
*** Medical
** Humanities
*** English
**** Literature
*** Law
*** Politics
