Management information dashboards are available to all authorised users. 

For users with responsibility specific to a faculty or school, only details of ethics applications within the relevant faculty or school will be shown on the dashboards. 

Information can be downloaded from each dashboard in excel format.

In addition to standard dashboards, institutions can request custom dashboards and reports by contacting Haplo Client Support via your Haplo Project Room.
