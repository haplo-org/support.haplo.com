title: External ethics approval 
long_title: Managing ethics approvals involving external bodies
--

Some ethics applications may require approval from ethics committees or boards which are external to the institution (most commonly in the UK are applications requiring approval from the NHS). 

How external approval is handled depends on the preferred process for each institution. 

h3. Option 1: Noting external approval received externally

Where the institution requires external approval to be achieved prior submission of the application to the institution, the researcher normally submits a brief application, attaching confirmation of the external approval. The application is routed to the appropriate reviewer or committee based on the institution's preferred process. 

h3. Option 2: Reviewing applications for external approval prior to their external approval

Where the institution prefers to review applications for external approval prior to their submission to the external body, the researcher submits a brief internal ethics application and copy of their external submission to the appropriate institutional reviewer who provides feedback via Ethics Monitor. 

The researcher applies for external approval directly with the external body. Once external approval is received, the applicant uploads confirmation of approval and any supporting document to Ethics Monitor. The appropriate reviewer or committee is notified. The applicant is sent confirmation of the institution's acknowledgement of the external approval.
