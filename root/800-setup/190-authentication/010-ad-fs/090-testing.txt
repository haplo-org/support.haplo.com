The first service provider we set up will be in a test environment. We need to make sure the configuration is correct, and that the correct information is being passed to the service provider to identify the user.

After we have finalised the configuration with your IdP metadata URL, we'll provide you with a test URL.

Visiting this URL in a browser will perform a test authentication, and then show you the data received back from your IdP.

Ensure that the data includes the right identifier to match the user information in your [node:setup/user-data:user sync]. This may be a username, email address, or other person identifier, and will depend on how the integrations are set up.
