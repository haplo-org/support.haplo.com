This document describes how to set up AD FS on Windows Server for use with Haplo Research Manager. Please read the [node:setup/authentication/ad-fs:overview documentation] first.

From the AD FS management tool, choose _Actions_ > _Add Relying Party Trust_ to launch the _Add Relying Party Trust Wizard_.

* Choose _Import data about the relying party published online or on a local network_

* Enter the _Identifier_ into the _Federation metadata address (hostname or URL)_ field.

* Click _Next_.

Check that the provided SAML Assertion Consumer Endpoint URL, ending @assertion-consumer-service@, has been successfully added, then close the wizard.

Once the wizard closes, open the _Edit Claim Rules_ dialog to configure which of your institution's LDAP Attributes are to be sent as SAML *claims*.

Typically this would be the username or email address from the Active Directory store, but your institute may have chosen to use an alternative attribute. If in doubt, add both username and email address.

* Click _Add rule..._

* In the _Mapping of LDAP attributes to outgoing claim types_ section add one or both of:

|*LDAP Attribute*|*Outgoing Claim Type*|
|User-Principal-Name|UPN|
|E-Mail-Addresses|E-Mail Address|

* Click _Finish_.

h2. Metadata URL

Finally, send the metadata URL for your AD FS instance to your Haplo contact. It will look like:

@https://id.example.ac.uk/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml@

You can "use PowerShell":https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/adfs/get-adfsendpoint?view=win10-ps to export the AD FS endpoints.

Or you can guess by replacing the @id.example.ac.uk@ hostname in the example URL with the hostname of your server. This is likely to be correct with a normal configuration.


h2. Testing the configuration

After we have set up the first service provider in a test environment, we'll need to [node:setup/authentication/ad-fs/testing:test the configuration].
