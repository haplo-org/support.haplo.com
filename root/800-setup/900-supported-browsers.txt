Haplo supports the current and previous versions of the following web browsers:

* Firefox
* Safari
* Google Chrome
* Microsoft Edge

These browsers are supported on the following platforms:

* Windows (PC)
* macOS (Apple)
* Another other platform supported by the browser vendor

In addition, there is support for:

* Microsoft Internet Explorer 11
* Any browser fully supported by Microsoft Office 365
* Any browser fully supported by Google G Suite for Education

Haplo is a standards compliant web application with fallback support when modern features are not available. Although not formally supported, you should expect any major web browser released in the last 7 years to work.

Where the application has a public interface (for example, Haplo Repository), the browser support is dependent on the branding and styling the institution chooses to apply.
