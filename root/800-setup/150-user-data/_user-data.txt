title: User sync and data migration
--

Information about your users and their projects needs to be provided as part of the setup. This falls into two main categories:

* The *ongoing* feed of information about *current* users,
* *Migrated* data, where the system of record is changed to Haplo, either,
** as an import of legacy data,
** or at a particular point in the user's involvement with the institution, such as enrolment.

The *user sync* manages the ongoing feed of user information for researchers and administrative staff. Some applications will also need details of students, and possibly taught students.

Migration of data uses *batch import* for legacy data, and the *user sync* where migration happens on an ongoing basis.


h2. Setup process

The Haplo team will work with you via the secure online [node:setup/project-room:Project Room] on the management of your data and configuration of the user sync. 

# We'll ask you to send us initial data files, your organisational structure, and any mappings via the Project Room.
# The Haplo team will configure your application and create your initial control file. 
# You'll complete the control file, to ensure data quality and complete data mappings.
# If a need to change the feed is identified during the implementation project, you may need to repeat the process.
# Near the end of the implementation project, you'll set up an automated feed of data from your live systems to the live Haplo environment.

Please refer to the specific documentation for the modules you are using:

[node:setup/user-data/phd-manager]
[node:setup/user-data/ethics-monitor]

When you use multiple modules, you will implement a single user sync containing the combined requirements for the modules.


h2. Technical reference

Haplo will work with you to manage the data throughout your implementation process. Technical information about the mechanisms used is provided in a [node:setup/user-data/technical:separate section] for reference.

The Haplo team will refer you to the relevant documentation during the process.
