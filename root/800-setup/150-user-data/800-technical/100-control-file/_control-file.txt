title: Control file
long_title: User sync control file
--

To set up the user sync, you need a "control file":https://docs.haplo.org/import/control to map the data you're providing.

The Haplo team will write the initial version of the control file, and hand it over to you for fine turning. To start this process, please send the initial data files and your organisational structure via your [node:setup/project-room] as JSON or XML files. Although we don't recommend it, we can also accept TSV files.

PhD Manager adds [node:setup/user-data/technical/control-file/phd-manager-model:project and supervisor information] to the data model.


h2. Writing a control file

If you prefer to create the initial control file yourself, it's best to start with the control file generator.

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > Data import > Models > haplo:user-sync > Generate control file...

Select all the fields for the _User account_ destination (@username@, etc), then select the other fields you're going to sync.

Refer to the model information page for the meaning of these fields.

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > Data import > Models > haplo:user-sync

After you have selected the fields, click _Generate control file_ to produce the initial version. Then, referring to the "user sync documentation":https://docs.haplo.org/import/user-sync, set up the input files and adjust the instructions and mappings.

h2. Managed groups

The user sync uses "Managed groups":https://docs.haplo.org/import/user-sync/user-groups to categorise the users in the sync. The control file will need to include a mapping from the category provided in the input files to the appropriate group code in Haplo. The following groups are available by default:

* @hres:group:researchers@ for academic staff
* @hres:group:admin-staff@ for non-academic staff

If your application will be used by PhD or taught students, the following groups will also be available in your system to categorise the students:

* @phd:group:doctoral-researchers@ for PhD students
* @hres:group:postgraduate-taught-students@ for postgraduate taught students
* @hres:group:undergraduate-students@ for undergraduate students
