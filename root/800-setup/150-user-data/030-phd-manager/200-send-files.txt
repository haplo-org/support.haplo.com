title: Sending initial data files
--

Upload your files to the [node:setup/project-room:Project Room] using the *User Sync and data migration* task, which will have been assigned to your technical lead for the project.

Include:

* initial user data file containing details of staff and students (and their projects)
* mappings for any codes used in the data files
* one-off import of previous suspensions, extensions, changes of mode
* one-off import of historical milestones
* one-off import file with end dates
* one-off import of past projects (if required)

The Haplo team will then write your initial control file for you to complete.

If any data is not immediately available, please let us know, and send the priority files of the user data and mappings.
