title: Moving workflows back
--

Your workflows will typically include "return" buttons at most steps of your workflow, which can be used by the user shown in the "currently with" box in the status panel.

Where this is not possible, for example, when a user makes an error, authorised users can override the workflow by moving it back a single step.
